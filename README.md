Third Year Project

### Project Description
This repository contains the code for an Android mobile application which provides an educational learning resource for British sign language (BSL). This app aims to find and improve on shortcomings of existing resources, with its unique selling point through the use of machine learning techniques, like sign recognition, with state-of-the-art models for BSL, combined with an efficient spaced reptition learning algorithm to optimise retention.
